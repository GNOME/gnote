<section id="navigating"><title>Navigating through long notes</title>

<p>
A long note may become difficult to navigate.
It is then natural to structure the note by
marking sections and subsections with headings.
</p>

<p>
This plugin makes it easy to navigate through long structured notes.
Once you have set headings in your note,
the table of contents of the note will show in actions menu.
Then you can jump directly from the menu to any heading.
</p>

</section>


<section id="setheadings"><title>Structuring your notes with headings</title>

<p>
A heading is simply a complete line with specific text formatting:
</p>
<list>
  <item><p>Level 1 headings, for sections, are lines formatted with a <gui>Bold+Huge</gui> font.</p></item>
  <item><p>Level 2 headings, for subsections, are lines formatted with a <gui>Bold+Large</gui> font.</p></item>
</list>


<p>To format a heading line, either:</p>

<list>
  <item>
    <p>Use the commands <gui>Heading 1</gui> and <gui>Heading 2</gui>
       in the <guiseq><gui>Actions</gui><gui>Table of Contents</gui></guiseq> menu.</p>
  </item>

  <item>
    <p>Use the keyboard shortcuts <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>1</key></keyseq>
    and <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>2</key></keyseq> for headings of level 1 and 2.</p>
 </item>
</list>

<note><p>
  These commands apply the formatting to the complete line.
  You don't need to select it first.
  It is enough if the cursor is on the line.
</p><p>
  Alternatively, with the cursor on a new line, activate the heading command and then enter the heading title.
</p></note>

<p>You can even use the normal formatting commands from the <gui>Text</gui> menu:
    <gui>Bold</gui>, <gui>Large</gui> and <gui>Huge</gui>, and their respective keyboard shortcuts.
    If, for example, your line is already formatted as <gui>Huge</gui>, then you just need to make it also <gui>Bold</gui> to turn it into a heading 1.
    See <link xref="editing-notes"/> to learn how to set text styles.
</p>

<section id="showtable"><title>Showing the table of contents</title>

<p>You can access the table of contents either:</p>
<list>
<item><p>In the menu <guiseq><gui>Actions</gui><gui>Table of Contents</gui></guiseq>.</p></item>
<item><p>In <guiseq><gui>context menu</gui><gui>Table of Contents</gui></guiseq> (right-click on the note window).</p></item>
<item><p>In a <gui>popup menu</gui>, with the keyboard shortcut <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Alt</key><key>1</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
<p>Then you can navigate up and down with the arrow keys and jump to the selected heading with <key>enter</key>. Or just click with your mouse on the heading to jump to.</p>
</list>

  <item><title><em style="strong">One heading does not show in the table of contents</em></title><p>
    There might be some characters in the heading line, such as whitespace characters, which are not formatted as a heading. Make sure that <em>the whole line</em> is formatted as a heading. See <link xref="#setheadings"/>.</p>
  </item>
  <item><title><em style="strong">There is an empty line in the table of contents</em></title><p>
    An empty line, possibly including whitespaces, is formatted as a heading. Jump to this line and delete the area.</p>
