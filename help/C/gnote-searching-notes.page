  <title>Exploring Notes</title>

  <p>The main <app>Gnote</app> window shows an overview of all your notes. By default the window will display notes in the order in which they were last modified. Click the <gui>Note</gui> or <gui>Last Changed</gui> column headings to change the sort order. Click a column heading a second time to toggle between ascending and descending order.</p>
  <p>You can find specific notes by clicking search button and entering text in the search field that appears. The note list will automatically update to include only the notes which have matching text. If notes list has focus, you can simply type search text there, search will be automatically activated.</p>
  <p>To open a note, do any of the following:</p>
  <list>
    <item><p>Double-click on a note.</p></item>
    <item><p>Right-click in the list of notes and select <gui>Open</gui> from the context menu. This will open all selected notes, each in its own window.</p></item>
    <item><p>Right-click in the list of notes and select <gui>Open in New Window</gui> from the context menu. This will open each selected note in a new window, leaving the original window as is.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select one or more notes in a list and press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>O</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
