   2013-06-10
   The add-in is globally complete feature-wise.
   This will target at the version 1.0
   See the TODO file for potential future features/ideas.

- code: s/header/heading/ everywhere

- help: added a screenshot

== 0.11
- fix: use bit-wise operations to test modifier masks (Ctrl/Alt)

== 0.10

       Use a single char one.

- updated description in .desktop
- TODO major update from my local notes, see: Todo, Maybe and Maybe not
- code: general code review, various minor updates in code, including:
  - add-in description in copyright headers
  - various code comments
  - renamed header level enum: s/Level/Header/ and s/H1,H2,H3/Title,Level_1,Level_2/
    (so forget the "HTML alike", now Ctrl-1/2 matches Level_1/2 (instead of H2/H3!))
  - renamed get_range_level() into get_header_level_for_range()
