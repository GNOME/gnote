.SH SYNOPSIS

.I "[OPTION] ..."

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR gnote
command.
.\"Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.
.PP
.B Gnote
is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and Unix. Simple and
easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas and
information you deal with every day.
.PP
Gnote's usefulness lies in the ability to relate notes and ideas
together, using a WikiWiki-like linking system.
.PP
When run without any options, either a Search All Notes window or
the Gnote note menu appears in the notification tray area
depending on configuration.  Selecting a note from a list in
Search All Notes or from the menu from notification area displays
the note's spatial window.
.PP
Changes to notes are saved automatically.  Links to URLs, files, and
other notes are detected as you type.  Rich editing such as
highlighting, bold, italics, undo/redo, and variable font sizes are
supported.
.PP
Global keybindings exist to allow fast access to Gnote notes and
dialogs.  These keybindings are set in GSettings (see below) and may
be activated from any application.
